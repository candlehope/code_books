We gathered up our worldly goods<br>
Stole off in the dawn as quickly as we could<br>
You were quieting the baby down<br>
When we came to the dock on the outskirts of town<br>
And looking back we saw China <br>
Shrinking to the size of a coin<br>
And then we saw water everywhere<br>
<br>
When we climbed on board<br>
They tied our things together with electrical cord<br>
And then we set sail<br>
As we held on tight to the cold iron rail<br>
And I apologize but I don't know what I love more<br>
You next to me there or the receding shore<br>
We stood there in the cold<br>
And the baby was six months old<br>
We were passing him back and forth<br>
When a cold familiar wind came down from the north<br>
And looking back we saw China <br>
Shrinking to the size of a coin<br>
And then we saw water everywhere <br>
