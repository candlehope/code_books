<p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">You must try to lead a good life <br>
You must do unto others as you would have them do<br>
So that when you die you'll find Golden Boy peanuts<br>
Waiting in the afterlife for you<br>

There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell<br>
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts<br>
There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell<br>
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts, yeah<br>
<br>
If thine enemy oppresseth you<br>
You must let him oppress you some more<br>
So that when you go shopping in paradise<br>
You'll find those magnificent peanuts from Singapore<br>
With the drawing of the young Chinese farmer<br>
The eastern sun behind him smiling at you from the shelves<br>
If we want to spend eternity in happiness<br>
Well, we're gonna have watch ourselves<br>
<br>
You must give to the March of Dimes<br>
You must be on guard against wickedness at all times<br>
And you will find that your efforts have brought you great joy<br>
When your spirit is munching on that Golden Boy<br>
<br>
There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell<br>
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts there<br>
But the streets of heaven are lined with shelves<br>
And there's billboards of the Golden Boy everywhere<br>
There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell<br>
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts<br>
There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell<br>
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts<br>
Go!<br>
